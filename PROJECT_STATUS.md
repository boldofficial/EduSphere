## 📞 API Integration

### Frontend Can Now Use
```typescript
// Bursary
POST /api/payments/                    // Record payment
GET  /api/payments/                    // List payments
POST /api/expenses/                    // Record expense

// Calendar  
POST /api/events/                      // Create event
GET  /api/events/                      // List events

// Messaging
POST /api/messages/                    // Send message
GET  /api/messages/                    // List messages
PUT  /api/messages/{id}/               // Mark as read
```

### React Hook Integration Ready
```typescript
// Can now implement:
const { data: payments } = useQuery(['payments'], fetchPayments);
const { mutate: recordPayment } = useMutation(createPayment);
const { data: events } = useQuery(['events'], fetchEvents);
const { mutate: sendMessage } = useMutation(postMessage);
```

## 🎓 Quality Assurance

### Testing Recommendations

**Unit Tests to Write:**
```python
# Test ViewSet filtering by school
def test_payment_filtered_by_school()

# Test auto-field population  
def test_payment_auto_recorded_by()

# Test message read tracking
def test_message_mark_as_read()

# Test event filtering
def test_events_by_type()
```

**Integration Tests to Write:**
```python
# Full payment workflow
# Full event creation workflow
# Full messaging workflow
# Multi-tenant isolation
```

**Load Tests:**
```bash
# Test 100 concurrent payment posts
